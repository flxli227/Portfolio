            <p>Surreal Dream is an escape room, which was a project for the Imperial College Advanced Hackspace.</p>
            <p>It was made in 2 months by Becky Hartnup, Felix Li (me) and Vaikkun Venkat.</p>

            <h2>Theme</h2>
            <p>Many escape rooms have a science or time travel theme.</p>
            <p>We wanted an escape room that can evoke a certain feeling while being located at a university lecture hall. We felt surrealism have enough reference material but still have creative freedom.</p>

            <h2>Puzzles</h2>
            <p>The aim of the escape room is to improve teamwork and communication of the players.</p>
            <p>Our first puzzle can only be if everyone is communicating. This is how it works:</p>

                src={require("./../assets/Escape Room/Blindfold.png")}
                alt="Two people solving the blindfold puzzle"

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Players are blindfolded and taken into the escape room.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They are each given a pair of headphones and a sound clue will playâ€‹
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the sound finishes, they are instructed to take their headphones off.
                </li>
            </ul>

                alt="Two people solving the painting puzzle"
            />
            <p>To solve the puzzle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    They have to realise each player is hearing a different sound
                </li>
                <li>
                    Communicate what they have heard
                </li>
                <li>
                    Decide where they are with reference to one of the pictures on the wall.
                </li>
